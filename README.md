Compiling a focused subset of utility and generator system data from the Cooling_Boiler_Generator_Data_Summary_2023 dataset for analysis and peer review.
# Cooling Boiler Generator Data Subset

## ✅ Overview
This project documents the creation of a focused subset from the publicly available `Cooling_Boiler_Generator_Data_Summary_2023.csv` dataset.  
It highlights temperature efficiency data in **utility** and **generator systems** by filtering for relevant columns and exporting a new CSV file.
