# cooling-boiler-generator-subset

Compiling a focused subset of utility and generator system data from the Cooling_Boiler_Generator_Data_Summary_2023 dataset for analysis and peer review.
# Cooling Boiler Generator Data Subset

## âœ… Overview
This project documents the creation of a focused subset from the publicly available `Cooling_Boiler_Generator_Data_Summary_2023.csv` dataset.  
It highlights temperature efficiency data in **utility** and **generator systems** by filtering for relevant columns and exporting a new CSV file.  

---

## âœ… Contents
- `Cooling_Boiler_Generator_Data_Summary_2023.csv` â€” Original dataset
- `compiled_utility_generator_subset.csv` â€” Filtered and compiled subset
- `subset_creation_notebook.ipynb` â€” Google Colab notebook documenting all steps

---

## âœ… Reproducibility Steps
1. Upload the original CSV to Google Colab (or through Google Drive).
2. Run the provided notebook to replicate filtering and subset creation.
3. Export and download the compiled CSV file.

---

## Provenance
The original dataset, **Cooling_Boiler_Generator_Data_Summary_2023.csv**, was sourced from a publicly available data repository focused on energy system performance in 2023.  
The subset was compiled as part of a computational methods assignment designed to promote reproducibility and public sharing of processed data.

---

## Purpose
This project aims to:
- Simplify a large, complex dataset for easier analysis
- Highlight key system identifiers for studying temperature efficiency
- Provide an open, reproducible workflow for dataset refinement

---

## Potential Applications
- Comparative analysis of generator system performance
- Visualization of temperature outputs across utility systems
- Baseline data for future predictive modeling projects
